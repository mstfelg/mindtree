## Motivation

MindTree is a math worksheet generator. Students, especially in middle school, cannot achieve mastery in math without practice. Whether you are a teacher, a parent, or even a student, you can tailor your own training worksheets with their answers. 

With randomly-generated worksheets, you can discourage students from copying answers since every worksheet has different problems. For students weak in math, adjusting difficulty level of the worksheets can help them progress better and prevent frustration. 

## Features

The problem with regular word documents is that they are a hassle to update, can't have their difficulty fine-tuned, and hard to customize. To solve this, MindTree offers the following features:

1. Free and open source. No paid memberships or fees.	
2. All worksheets are customizable and downloadable from the web. No logins, programs, or apps need to be installed.
3. Easily extensible interface: teachers can add their own math problems. 
4. Customizable stylesheets and layouts.
5. Easy header and footer customizability via basic HTML.
6. LaTeX support: equations are elegantly typeset using KaTeX.

## Challenges

Unforunately, there is no "Sympy" equivalent in JavaScript. This could be a project on its own, but I noticed during development the recurrent need to write math parsers and use advanced math library functions. 

## What's next

MindTree serves as a simple basis for managing question banks. The teacher does not have to be concerned by designing questions, since it will be automatically styled by MindTree.
